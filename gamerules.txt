SETUP:
Each player starts with the same set of 25 cards, and make 5 piles of 5 cards.

One the bottom of one of the piles each player hides their crown card,
 and they can set up the rest of the cards however they like.

Then players take turns attacking their opponents piles with the cards on
 top of their own piles.

GAMEPLAY:
The card with the lowest  number is discarded, and the winning card is
 returned face down to its original pile.

If both cards have the same number both are dicarded.

The game ends when one of the players attacks the other player's crown card.

RULES:
Archer cards always win when attacking, but always lose when they are
 attacked.

If your opponent attacks a shield card both cards are discarded.

If you only have shield cards left, you must discard a shield card on your
 turn.

Players may look at the cards in their piles before every turn.

Discarded cards must be kept face down and cannot be looked at during the game.

Players cannot move cards to different piles once the game has begun.

Instead of attacking, you may intentionally discard a card on your turn

You can attack with your crown card. If you attack your opponents crown card
 you win, otherwise you lose.

You cannot discard your crown card.

If a shield card is attacked by a archer card neither are discarded at both
 return to their piles.

The first player to finish setting their piles goes first.
